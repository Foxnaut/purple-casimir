Project components:
- HTML and CSS frontend (primarily written by Aiden and Aathii)
- game design and mechanics (done by Josh)
- web backend for score retention and presentation (Kavin did this component)

Goals:
- have fun
- learn more of the respective languages we used 
- make a game that children might actually find fun
- format a good looking product in the end (which as the frontend guy is my job :/ - Aiden)
